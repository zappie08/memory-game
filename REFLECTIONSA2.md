When I initially picked this repo to fork and to continue development, I looked at only a few critical points, such as whether it fits the brief (Vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS) and its previous forking history. 
Limiting my search criteria by primarily focusing on forking history gave me a false sense of how active a project is in development. Looking deeper into some of the projects I dismissed, quite a few have had recent developments while having a minimal number of forks. 
Although it might be better to have picked a more recent project, I was not too worried about it as web technology has been highly stable with no significant breaking changes in the past few years. 

After I had set on my selected project, I was pleasantly surprised when I looked into the code structure. The basis of the original project was to demonstrate a few critical features of javascript as a tutorial, so most of the functions and instructions were at a basic introductory level, which gave me a fantastic foundation on which to start building.

The initial task that I wanted to work on was making the game more fun to play. Initially, the tiles acted as if they were buttons with no feedback apart from an ugly alert window. These two aspects alone made the game much less fun to play. I wanted to refactor the "image clicking" function to allow card-flipping animation to make the game more immersive. However, as I started this implementation, I started to notice the downsides of developing with such a basic framework. I needed to add a lot more code than I had thought just because of how the cards were being displayed on the HTML page. I decided to re-work the card generation function which solved my issues with the flipping animation but it also meant that I had already refactored a large percentage of the code. I had to stop and reflect on whether it would've been simpler to just start a project from scratch or to continue with this development. I did however notice that I had begun to over complicate the logic and reduced it down to a bare minimum which allowed me to retain a big chunk of the original code.

I think next time when I am looking for a project to fork or contribute towards, I shouldn't only focus on its project tags and its forking history but I should also analyse the existing code and use the documentation to aid me in determining if this project will allow to contribute effeciently to it. The features that I implemented to my memory game really tested the foundation that it had originally, and if I were to add more features to this project, I would have to really think as to whether it would be faster to just start as a blank project or to spend a few more hours to utilise 100% of the existing code.

I also think that my assumption of the stability/development of web technology was slightly wrong. At one point, I was stuck trying to figure out how to implement the confetti effect. I looked online and found many depreciated and unmaintained methods/libraries that didn't end up working. Although the suggestions online were only 4+ years old, it made me aware that even web dev which in the past has been extremely stable and reliable is also susceptible to being outdated. Along side looking at documentation and project code, I need to also consider the level of community support and publicly available information to help me decide if a project is suitable to be developed on. 

Overall this assignment was a great experience. I had not contributed to an open source project let alone fork and take development ownership. It has definitely exposed me to a different side of development.
