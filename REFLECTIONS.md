While searching for a GitHub project, I noticed a common trend: projects with modular design and clear documentation offer high value to their users with manageable complexity. 
An example I found but ultimately chose not to use for this assignment was Fooocus, an open-source version of Midjourney. This project stood out as the clever structure of their documentation makes it beginner-friendly by getting straight to the point at the start of the documentation, where users can download the project immediately. However, reading further gives advanced users or developers opportunities to explore various available configuration options where they can use the program's full potential or learn more about the project to start developing or enhancing features. 
This experience of looking for a project to use for this assignment has influenced my criteria not only for selecting GitHub projects but also for my own personal projects to ensure that I provide users with the same opportunity, regardless of their skill level, to use and understand the projects I work on.

The project I selected was per the brief, which specified to use of an open-source project written in Javascript/HTML/CSS.
Adapting this project was not too difficult with the help of the video tutorial provided on Canvas. Installing Neutralinojs via brew (on mac) made the whole experience very easy.
Forking, Cloning and then combining the original forked repo with the Neutralinojs file structure was also relatively easy due to the simple nature of the project I selected.
However, while testing the project still worked in Neutralinojs, I noticed that Windows and Mac treat alert windows differently. In Windows, it appears as you would expect in a browser, but it simply does not show on Mac. This would be something for me to take into consideration when improving on this project in the future.
